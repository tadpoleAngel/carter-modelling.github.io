<h1>Carter Modelling</h1>

<p>
Carter Modelling provides custom 3D-printed scale models of residential homes,
created from client-provided plans or reference materials.
</p>

<h2>Services</h2>
<p>
Each project includes digital 3D modeling and a physical printed model.
Pricing varies by size and complexity; most models start around $100.
</p>

<h2>Delivery</h2>
<p>
Most orders are completed within 4–5 business days.
Finished models are delivered locally or arranged for pickup.
</p>

<h2>Refunds</h2>
<p>
Because models are custom-made, refunds are generally not available once production has begun.
Any issues with print quality will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.
